## Some problems I ran into:
1. I got very confused having to pass all the data around.
2. Don't understand exactly how to use async functions or axios promises.
3. Some glitches in the user experience. (i.e. loading list of the user's watched stocks) 

## Things I didn't get to do/finish:
1. Fix glitches
2. Make it look good
3. Add Snapshots (3rd model)
4. Options to display graph by time (week vs month vs years)
